PlayUI
======

A CSS/SASS UI kit to help building beautiful applications for the web.


All components are prefixed with play- this way you will still be able to use other
CSS frameworks without breaking the website. We also try to use as little classes
as possible and try to relay on wrappers for components. This will make your 
HTML less look like spaghetti and make the code more readable.

PlayUI is open-source and welcomes contributions and forks.

Please check example/ for usage of the components. Documentation coming soon.

Happy creating!
